        <b>This wizard will add your SMA inverter to Homey</b>
        <br/><br/>
        The app will try to find the inverter using the SMA speedwire auto-discovery protocol. If this is not successful the app will present a form where you can manually enter the IP address of your inverter.
        <br/><br/>
        <i>Please note that your inverter needs to be configured to use the the same port number as you have specified in the app settings. The default port number is 502.</i>
